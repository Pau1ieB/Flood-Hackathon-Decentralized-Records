This is a proposal for a Decentralized Record System for the Flood Hackathon.

To use, clone the repo and use 'npm start'

It is not production level; rather it demonstrates how the system may work in practice.

In the wake of a disaster many individuals can be separated from close family members and may require personalised care, all while in a highly chaotic environment. This system allows individuals to store a record of their name, family, medical requirements and preferences on a QR code that can be kept on their person and quickly accessed by relief organisations when necessary.

An individual can obtain a QR code at any time from clinics such as a surgery or hospital, or online (the "NEW RECORD function").

The record can be updated when required (eg when medical treatments change). A new QR code is generated to replace the old one (The "UPDATE RECORD" function).

Individual QR codes can be linked to each other via a family code. A source (that provides the required family code) and a destination QR code are required. A new destination QR code with the updated family code is generated to replace the old one. This would allow tracking individuals from the same family to be simplified, where the family unit has been separated (the "UPDATE FAMILY" function).

Access to the record by relief organisations (the "READ RECORD" function).
